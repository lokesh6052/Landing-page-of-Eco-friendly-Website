This website's landing page was built using a combination of web development tools and technologies. These tools include front-end programming languages like HTML (used for structuring the web page), CSS (used for styling and layout), and JavaScript (used for adding interactivity).

In addition to these basic languages, the project also uses a few JavaScript libraries to enhance its functionality. These libraries include GSAP (GreenSock Animation Platform) for creating animations, Shery.js for some specific functionality, and Locomotive JS for smooth scrolling and navigation.

It's worth noting that this project is designed with beginner-level developers in mind. This means that it's a great starting point for those who are new to web development. The project's code and features are intentionally kept at a level that is approachable and manageable for beginners who want to learn and practice their web development skills.
